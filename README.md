# bbb-controller

## Api v1

The api is accessable under `/api/v1/{endpoint}`.

### Authentication
Authentication to the API is done via [RCP](https://github.com/myOmikron/rcp).
The endpoint is used as salt whereas the key for the checksum is `checksum`.
The authentication is required at every endpoint.

### Parameters and responses

In `POST` requests parameters and the authentication checksum are to be provided as a valid json object in the request's body.

Unless stated otherwise every endpoint responds is a valid json object of the following form:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "This is a short summary or error message"
}
```

### External Endpoints

#### `startStream`

This method starts a stream for a running bigbluebutton meeting.

The starting process may take a minute, but since this project only forwards commands to others, this method will responde before the stream is actually running.

- Method: `POST`

Parameters      | Required | Type | Description
----------------|----------|------|------------
meeting_id      | Yes      | str  | The id of a running bigbluebutton meeting.
welcome_msg     | No       | str  | A welcome message that gets displayed on the chat window when the participant joins.
redirect_url    | No       | str  | An url to redirect the users to, once the stream ended.

#### `joinStream`

Redirect a user to where he can watch the streamed meeting.

This endpoint's url needs to be generated by an authorized party and then requested by the user himself.

Similar to bbb's join, this ensures that the user came from an authorized location.

It does not respond with a json object but redirects the requester to the [frontend](https://github.com/myOmikron/bbb-frontend)

- Method `GET`

Parameters      | Required | Type | Description
----------------|----------|------|------------

user_name       | Yes      | str  | User's name to display in participants list and chat

#### `endStream`

This method stops a streamed bigbluebutton meeting's stream.

- Method: `POST`

Parameters      | Required | Type | Description
----------------|----------|------|------------
meeting_id      | Yes      | str  | The id of a streamed bigbluebutton meeting.
